**A comprehensive collection of Jupyter notebooks** showcasing my journey in data science, machine learning, data analysis, visualization, web scraping, and time series forecasting.

This repository serves as a personal learning and project portfolio. It includes beginner-to-intermediate tutorials on core Python data science libraries, as well as practical projects involving real-world datasets from platforms like Airbnb, Flipkart, Amazon, CarDekho, and more.

## About This Repository

This repo documents my hands-on practice with Python for data science and machine learning. It started as a learning space and has grown into a portfolio of projects covering:
- Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization
- Supervised & unsupervised machine learning
- Web scraping with Selenium and BeautifulSoup
- Time series analysis and forecasting
- Customer behavior modeling (e.g., churn prediction)

All notebooks are self-contained with explanations, code, and visualizations.

## Core Library Tutorials

These folders contain structured tutorials and examples for foundational libraries.

- **[Matplotlib](Matplotlib/)**  
  Basic to advanced plotting: line plots, scatter plots, subplots, customization, 3D plots, animations.

- **[NumPy](Numpy/)**  
  Array operations, broadcasting, linear algebra, random number generation, performance tips.

- **[Pandas](Pandas/)**  
  Series & DataFrames, data cleaning, merging, grouping, time series handling, I/O operations.

- **[Seaborn](Seaborn/)**  
  Statistical visualizations: heatmaps, pair plots, distribution plots, categorical plots, themes.
